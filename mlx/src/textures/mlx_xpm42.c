 * XPM is an obscure image format which can't seem to make up its mind
 * wether it wants to be written in C code or not.
 * 
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap
 * 
 * This might anger some but instead I decided to write my own
 * image format, very similar to XPM2, which seems to be the better
 * option between the 3 versions. The only difference is in the
 * header which carries the file type, width, height, color count
 * and finally color type aka 'c' for RGBA8 or 'm' for monochrome
 * output.
 * 
 * The changes, in my opinion, very much simplify the XPM format
 * into something literally anybody can use without much guessing
 * as to what does what.
 * 
 * Additionally with the C style format, the idea is that you simply include
 * it directly into the compilation of the program (since its just c).
 * 
 * As convenient as this is, I just find it hideous especially the XPM3 variant.
 * By sticking to the XPM style format, conversion should be very easy and 
 * straight forward to this format however.
